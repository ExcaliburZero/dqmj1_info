Synthesis
=========
Synthesis is a system where you can combine two monsters into a new, typically stronger, monster.

********
Polarity
********
Each monster has a polarity value which restricts which monsters it can be synthesized with.

* Positive polarity monsters (+) can by synthesized with negative and neutral monsters.
* Negative polarity monsters (-) can by synthesized with positive and neutral monsters.
* Neutral polarity monsters (+/-) can by synthesized with positive and negative monsters.

The child monster created in sythesis will have its polarity chosen randomly with the following chances:

* Neutral = ~5.9 %
* Positive = ~47.06 %
* Negative = ~47.06 %

The polarity of the child monster can also be influenced by giving one of the parents the Plus Sceptre or the Minus Sceptre which will make the child monster's polarity positive and negative respectively.

Equiping the one parent with the Plus Sceptre and the other with the Minus Sceptre will result in the child monster's polarity being random (as if no sceptres were equiped).
